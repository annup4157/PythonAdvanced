    "Ans: It helps with the way instance attribute are stored. Within a class method in Python, whenever a method assigns to a self attribute e.g: self.attr = value, it changes or creates an attribute in the instance. Because this is true even if multiple classes in a hierarchy assign to the same attribute, collisions are possible. By adding __ before variable name you can make it private."
