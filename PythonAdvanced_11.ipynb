    "Ans: They are usually subclasses of type class, it is a class used to create a class. They redefined methods like new and init to tap into class creation protocol. Metaclass is responsible for making and returning an object for the new class. Metaclass attributes are only available in the class instances. It is class of a class."

Decorators augment and return oroignal class object where as, metaclass route class creation through a callable and augment class after they create it so metaclass is more beneficial here as they define new class rather than using orignal class."
